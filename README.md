## Project Overview

The project provides a recommendation system to suggest videos to users based on their past interactions (like, view, rate, and inspire). The goal is to use content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models to provide personalized video recommendations.

### Key Features:
- Personalized video recommendations based on the user’s historical interactions.
- API endpoints that accept parameters such as `username`, `category_id`, and `mood` to provide tailored recommendations.
- Solves the "cold start problem" for new users by leveraging mood data.
- Incorporates both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework used for developing the API.
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for development.
- **pandas, numpy**: Libraries used for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **sklearn**: Used for implementing collaborative filtering models.
- **requests**: For making API calls to fetch video metadata.
- **JSON**: Data format for interaction data and video metadata.

## Data Preprocessing

- The data is fetched from external APIs. Here's how the data is processed:

1. Data Fetching:

- Data is fetched from the provided API endpoints.
- Pagination is used to ensure that data isn't fetched repeatedly.

2. Data Cleaning:

- Missing values are handled by filling or removing incomplete records.
- Data normalization ensures consistency in values across different features.

3. Feature Engineering:

- Additional features are created from raw data to enhance the recommendation models, such as categorizing videos, extracting tags, and mapping user preferences.

## Algorithm Selection

1. Content-Based Filtering:

- Content-based filtering recommends videos similar to those the user has interacted with (e.g., viewed, liked). It uses metadata (tags, categories) to find similar videos. This approach works well for users with historical data.

2. Collaborative Filtering:

- Collaborative filtering recommends videos based on the preferences of similar users. This model can improve as more user data is collected. It’s effective when users have diverse preferences but may struggle with new users who don’t have enough interaction history (cold start problem).

3. Hybrid Model:

- A hybrid model combines content-based and collaborative filtering to leverage the strengths of both. It offers personalized recommendations while minimizing the limitations of each individual model.

- The hybrid model was chosen to combine the accuracy of content-based filtering with the broader scope of collaborative filtering, ensuring high-quality recommendations for a wide range of users.


## Evaluation Metrics

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
- MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in the recommendations. The lower the MAE, the better the model’s accuracy.

2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):

- RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE, providing a more sensitive measure of recommendation quality.

## Testing

* Unit Tests:
    - Unit tests are written for each model to ensure correctness.
    - API testing ensures that the endpoints return the correct recommendations.

### Key Points Addressed:
- **Model Selection**: Justified the use of hybrid models that combine content-based and collaborative filtering to handle diverse user needs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Summarized how MAE and RMSE are used to assess the model’s recommendation accuracy.
- **Documentation**: Provides detailed setup instructions, API usage, and project structure explanations.
